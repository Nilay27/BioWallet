2. [BlockEden](#blockeden)

### Wormhole (Multichain-Track)
We leverage **Wormhole's Cross-Chain Protocol** to facilitate seamless cross-chain transactions directly from our Mobile Phones, transforming them into **Cross-Chain Hardware Wallets**. This integration harnesses the power of the Wormhole SDK to support versatile signature schemes and enable cross-chain functionality.

Following are the features of our integration:

- **Using Wormhole SDK in Swift**: Interacting with the Wormhole SDK in Swift for cross-chain transactions, even though the SDK is primarily in TypeScript.
  ```swift
  func buildBridgeTransaction(recipientChain: String, senderAddress: String, receiverAddress: String, amountToSend: String) async throws -> Data? {
        let urlString = "http://localhost:3000/prepareTransactionBlock"
        guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else {
            return nil
        }
        let payload: [String: Any] = [
            "recipientChain": recipientChain,
            "senderAddress": senderAddress,
            "receiverAddress": receiverAddress,
            "amountToSend": amountToSend
        ]
        guard let jsonData = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: payload, options: []) else {
            return nil
        }
        var request = URLRequest(url: url)
        request.httpMethod = "POST"
        request.httpBody = jsonData
        request.addValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
        
        let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
        guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpResponse.statusCode == 200 else {
            return nil
        }
        do {
            let serializedTransaction = try JSONDecoder().decode(SerializedTransaction.self, from: data)
            let transactionBlockBytes = Data(serializedTransaction.transactionBlock)
            return transactionBlockBytes
           } catch {
               print("Error decoding the transaction block: \(error)")
               return nil
        }
    }
  ```

- **Custom Node Server for Wormhole SDK**: Setting up a local Node.js server to interact with the Wormhole SDK and handle cross-chain transactions.
  ```javascript
  app.post('/prepareTransactionBlock', async (req, res) => {
    const { recipientChain, senderAddress, receiverAddress, amountToSend } = req.body;
    const wh = await wormhole("Mainnet", [evm, sui]);
    const ctx = wh.getChain("Sui");  
    ctx.config.rpc = "https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443/";
    const rcv = wh.getChain(recipientChain as Chain);
    const sndTb = await ctx.getTokenBridge();    
    const sender: UniversalOrNative<"Sui"> = new UniversalAddress(senderAddress);
    const recipient: ChainAddress<Chain> = {
        chain: recipientChain as Chain,
        address: new UniversalAddress(receiverAddress)
    };
    const transfer = sndTb.transfer(
        sender,
        recipient,
        "native",
        amount.units(amount.parse(amountToSend, ctx.config.nativeTokenDecimals)),
    );
    const tx = await transfer.next();
    const suiClient = await ctx.getRpc()
    if (tx.done) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'No transaction was created' });
    } else {
        tx.value.transaction.setSenderIfNotSet(senderAddress)
        const serializedTransaction = await tx.value.transaction.build({client: suiClient})
        const serializedTransactionArray = Array.from(serializedTransaction);
        res.json({ transactionBlock: serializedTransactionArray });
        }   
    }); 
  ```

- **Cross-Chain Transactions**: Facilitating cross-chain token transfers directly from Swift by communicating with the Node.js server that utilizes the Wormhole SDK.

- **Secure Signature Handling**: Using Secure Enclave for signing transactions, ensuring high security for cross-chain operations.

- **Transaction Preparation and Processing**: Preparing and processing transactions through the Node.js server, then signing and executing them in Swift.
  ```swift
   public func signAndExecuteBridgeTransaction(recipientChain: String, senderAddress: String, receiverAddress: String, amountToSend: String) async throws -> SuiTransactionBlockResponse{
        guard let transactionBlockBytes = try await self.buildBridgeTransaction(recipientChain: recipientChain, senderAddress: senderAddress, receiverAddress: receiverAddress, amountToSend: amountToSend) else {
            throw NSError(domain: "Failed to build bridgeTransaction", code: -1)
        }
        let transactionBlockWithIntent = RawSigner.messageWithIntent(.TransactionData, transactionBlockBytes)
        let blake2bDigest = try Blake2b.hash(size: 32, data: transactionBlockWithIntent)
        
        let signature = try await self.signDataAsync(data: blake2bDigest) // Use SecureEnclaveManager to sign the transaction block
    
        // rest of the code
        return try await self.provider.executeTransactionBlock(transactionBlock: transactionBlockBytes.base64EncodedString(), signature: serializedSignature)
    }
  ```

- **Multichain Support**: Enabling multichain calls and interactions to enhance the application's functionality across different blockchain networks.
